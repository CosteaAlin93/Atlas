## Task 1 Introduction Room Overview and Deploy! 

This is an introductory level room which aims to teach you the very basics of Windows system exploitation, from initial access, through to privilege escalation.

**Answer the questions below**

### Press the Green "Start Machine" button to deploy the machine!

---

## Task 2 Enumeration: Port Scanning 

**Enumeration** is probably the most important thing when comes to solving any challenge.


**Answer the questions below**

### Scan your target IP (10.10.200.252) with Nmap!

Let's add a bit of flavour here, to have a more complex scan with output to a text file for later review:

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -v -oN Atlasnmapscan.txt $ip -p- -Pn`

### With the Nmap default port range, you should find that two ports are open. What port numbers are these?

Reffer to the above **scan** ; the 2 ports are appearing quickly with the verbose output.

### What service does Nmap think is running on the higher of the two ports?

The answer is found in the bottom of the nmap scan.

### We would usually go on to do a lot more in-depth scanning, but we will leave it at that for this introductory room. We have what we need for the time being.

> Here, it's a reference for the nmap scan switches mentioned above.

## Task 3 Enumeration: Service Enumeration 

Doing the scan as suggested above, will contain this part.
- First service : 3389 RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol, used to get remote graphic desktop session ;
- Second service: 8080 HTTP-PROXY; 
 By accessing it into a web browser, we get prompted to authenticate

We're going to curl the target to get more info:

`curl $ip:8080 -v`

**Answer the questions below**


### Use searchsploit to find the vulnerability in ThinVNC

`searchsploit ThinVNC`

## Task 4 Attack Foothold 

**Answer the questions below**

# Clone the Git repository at https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/CVE-2019-17662  to your attacking machine.

`git clone https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/CVE-2019-17662`

# Switch into the newly created exploit directory and set the file to be executable 

- First check with `ll`; if the file is executable already, go to next task.

# Read through the exploit help menu

`./CVE-2019-17662.py --help`

- This script requires two arguments

# Use the credentials found by the script to get past the HTTP Basic Auth presented when trying to access the vulnerable service in your web browser. You should have access to a user desktop!

We could use the inbrowser version or we could use Remmina for this task.

- `sudo apt install remmina`
- After you have it installed, open `remmina`
- Click on "Add new connection" where you put the newfound details

- RIght CLick > Connect

## Task 5 Access VNC ðŸ – RDP 

---

If the above step worked for you, then you should be already conencted to the machine via Remmina.

However, the mentioned method here is working too.

`xfreerdp /v:10.10.200.252 /u:USERNAME /p:PASSWORD /cert:ignore +clipboard /dynamic-resolution /drive:/tmp,share`

> Replace USERNAME and PASSWORD arguments with your findings
